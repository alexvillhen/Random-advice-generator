## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOM manipulation with vainilla JS
- fetch API
- JSON API

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use the fetch and json API's to work with async function and promises. 
This was very fun for me since this is the first project in which I implement this API's.
```
```js
const addQuote = () => {
    const requestAdvice = fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice");
    requestAdvice.then( response => {
        return response.json()
    })
    .then(json => {
        result.innerHTML = `"${json.slip.advice}"`;
        id.innerHTML = `Advice #${json.slip.id}`;
    });
}
```


### Continued development

Now that I feel more confident working with promises I'll keep working on projects using different API's (I'd love to find a way to use the Rick and Morty API on a future project ðŸ˜…).

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing) - This helped me a lot to finally undestand what are, and how to use promises.

## Acknowledgments

I'd recomend to everyone that is struggling with async programming and promises to read the MDN documentation about this subject and just try to buld somethig, this project actually helped me A LOT to have a better understanding of the fecth API.
